			<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryu_(Street_Fighter)" target="_blank">Ryu</a> (Japanese: リュウ, Hepburn: <a onclick="janelinha()"><u>RyūM</u></a>) is a fictional Japanese fighting character and the main protagonist of Capcom's Street Fighter series.[6] Having premiered in the first Street Fighter in 1987, Ryu appears as the game's lead character alongside his best friend Ken Masters. Other games in the series show Ryu to be highly focused on his training, aiming to become the strongest he can. In some games, Ryu has an alternative form known as Evil Ryu (殺意の波動に目覚めたリュウ, Satsui no Hadō ni Mezameta Ryū, lit. "Ryu with the surge of murderous intent awakened", abbreviated Satsui Ryu in Street Fighter Alpha 3), which is the form Ryu takes while he is under the domination of the surge of murderous intent. Ryu purges the surge of murderous intent manifesting in Street Fighter V, an independent being called Kage (影, lit. Shadow), or in Japan by the full name Kage-naru mono (影ナル者, lit. Shadowed One).</p>

			<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Masters" target="_blank">Ken Masters</a> (ケン・マスターズ Ken Masutāzu?) is a video game character and deuteragonist of the Street Fighter series, first appearing in the original Street Fighter. Similar to his longtime best friend and rival Ryu, Ken's goal is to test his power against many different fighters and strives to become stronger, but holds more restraint due to not wanting to jeopardize his family life.</p>

"Great Demon" or "Great Ogre"), is a fictional character from the Street Fighter series of fighting games by Capcom. Akuma made his debut in Super Street Fighter II Turbo as a secret character and hidden Boss. In the storyline of the Street Fighter video games, he is the younger brother of Gouken, Ryu's and Ken's master. In some games he also has an enhanced version named Shin Akuma or Shin Gouki (真・豪鬼, Shin Gōki, the "true Great Demon") in Japanese.
